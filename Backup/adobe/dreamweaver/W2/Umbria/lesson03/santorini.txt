We loved Santorini more than any other spot we went. Everything is incredibly beautiful, every vista looks like a postcard. The food and shopping were outstanding and we loved the hotel you picked for us.

The food at the little bistro on the roof with the caldera view of the setting sun is beyond extraordinary. We ate there four times and every item we tried was wonderful. Thanks for all your help in giving us a wonderful trip.

My whole family loved Santorini. Our hotel was so wonderful with massages and great food. The shopping was fun. But our favorite was the beach. We like the watersports and the great little tavernas near the water.
