    <p>The large island of Naxos has something for everyone. Wander the capital of Chora and enjoy the seaside dining, the fishing boats, the delightful shops and the nearby beaches.</p>
    <p>Walk through the warren of wonderful shops and resturants to the castle atop the hill. It's a fairyland at night.</p>
    <p>A short stretch from Chora's seaside restaurant row to the marble Portera marking the site of an abandoned temple is a lovely stroll at sunset.</p>
    <p>Take a day trip into the mountains and see the charming villages and beautiful mountain vistas. Enjoy local shops selling fine hand woven fabrics and cafes with the freshest and most delicious food you'll find anywhere. </p>
    <p>The mountains shelter golden fertile valleys where you'll see fields and crops mingled with small churches and imposing churches.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Beautiful sandy beaches dot the coastline. Naxos boasts almost 100 kilometers of perfect sandy beaches where you can just relax in the sun or enjoy water sports that are fun for the whole family.</p>
    <p>Let us arrange your stay at the loveliest spot on the island. We'll even tell you which restaurants you'll want to visit again and again.</p>
