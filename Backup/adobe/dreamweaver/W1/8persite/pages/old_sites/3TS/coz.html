        <h2 align="center">Culture</h2>
      <p> The people of Cozumel blend the tradition of Mexico with the soul of the Caribbean. The people are friendly and aim to make visitors feel welcome.When visiting, be sure to observe siesta (a time to rest between 1 and 4pm daily) so that you can extend your bed time and enjoy a later supper and dance well into the early morning.
</p>
      <p>Cozumel has always been a center for trade and navigation, but ancient Mayans regarded the island as a very sacred place. You will see many Mayan remains all over the island depicting Ixchel, the deity of the moon, pregnancy and childbirth. During 600 – 1200 A.D. female Mayans from the mainland would make the dangerous pilgrimage to Cozumel via canoes to worship Ixchel at least once in their life.</p>
<h2 align="center">Climate</h2>
      <p> Cozumel generally has good weather all year round. The summer months are the hottest and most humid, and also have more rain. <br />
        <br />
        The average annual temperature is around 81°F (27°C). From November to May, temperatures are slightly lower at about 77°F (25°C).<br />
        <br />
      Cozumel's island geography means that even on the hottest days there is usually some breeze to keep you fresh.  </p>
