        <h2 align="center">Culture</h2>
        <p>The Belizean culture is made up of influences and people from Kriol, Maya, Garinagu (also known as Garifuna), Mestizo (a mixture ofSpanish and Native Americans), Mennonites who are of German descent, with a blend of many other cultures from Chinese to Lebanese. It is a unique blend that emerged through the country's long and occasionally violent history.</p>
        <p>Courtesy is important to most Belizeans. It is not uncommon for Belizeans to greet each other on the street even if they have never seen each other before, or for acquaintances to spend minutes at a time chatting, oblivious to what is happening around them. Another aspect of the culture is the idea of the mystical healing and Obeah. However, there is still talk of evil shaman practices like putting &quot;Obeah&quot; on certain houses. This is known to be done by burying a bottle with the 'evil' under a tree close by the house.</p>
        <h2 align="center">Climate </h2>
        <p align="left"> There is a dry season and a rainy season each year in Belize. The dry season is when most tourists visit the country: from December through May. Rainy season lasts from June through November. It depends what the elevation is, but the levels of annual rainfall can vary enormously from area to area. For such a small country, we see great diversity in amounts of rain received. For example, in the Corozal District in the northern part of Belize, the average rainfall is about 50 inches per year.</p>
      <p align="left"> If you go south to Belize City, the average is up to 79 inches. If you go further south and a little east, to Punta Gorda, you get 177 inches a year. In all regions, albeit less so in the mountainous areas, humidity is high. Conditions are moist and tropical. Belize City is warm all year round, with average temperatures at a pleasant 72 degrees in the dry season and up to 88 degrees in the rainy season. If you go up to Mountain Pine Redge, average low temperature drops to a cool 63 degrees F in December. </p>
