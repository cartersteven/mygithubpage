        <h2 align="center">Culture</h2>
        <p align="justify">Parrots, iguana, and monkeys live in the wild on this tropical Caribbean island.  An iguana farm east of French Harbor provides a refuge for thousands of iguanas and is open for tourists. Iguanas have been a culinary delicacy for inhabitants of Roatan for generations.  Hunting and eating iguanas has been a part of Roatan's culture for many years. The Honduran goverment has laws to protect wildlife and the reef to preserve Roatan's ecological heritage into the future.</p>
        <p align="justify">Tourism thrives on Roatan, with thousands of tourists travelling here each year, not just for the sea, but for enjoying the local culture, the mild climate, and the fascination of Roatan's colorful history. Tourism also benefits the neighboring Caribbeans islands of Utila and Guanaja, which are more remote from conveniences and give the traveller the feeling he has stepped back in time.</p>

      <h2 align="center">Climate</h2>
      <p align="left"> Roatan is the largest island at 32 miles long and from one to three miles wide. A small mountain ridge runs along the spine of the island offering expansive ocean vistas with the highest point at about 900 feet above sea level. The island has varying topography from white sandy beaches, iron shoreline, mangroves, tropical hilltops, lush valleys to reef surrounded waters. </p>
      <p align="left">The diversity of the landscape on Roatan makes it one of the most visually impressive locations in the Caribbean. In the 18th century Captain James Wright referred to Roatan as the &quot;Garden of the West Indies&quot;. Today, Roatan still retains its true tropical beauty.</p>
      <p align="left">The yearly average temperature in Roatan is 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The island receives constant trade winds keeping the climate cool and a reasonable rainfall, with the heaviest rains from December to February. This rainfall keeps the island lush and green.</p>
